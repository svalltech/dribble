# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "SOLUTION: The import statements in server.py need to be fixed. Lines 14-18 should use relative imports like 'from .models import *' instead of 'from models import *'. Similarly, other imports should be updated to use relative imports. This is a common Python module import issue. Once fixed, the backend server should start properly and the API endpoints should work correctly."

    message: "Completed simplified frontend testing of the DRIBBLE website. The frontend UI is working correctly with proper DRIBBLE branding. All UI components (header, navigation, size chart, FAQ section) are rendering and functioning as expected. Quantity input fields accept numeric values and display order calculations correctly. The FAQ section now works properly - only one FAQ can be open at a time. The website is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile views. However, all backend API calls are still failing with 502 errors, preventing any server-side functionality from working. The admin panel route (/admin-ui/dashboard) is not defined in the frontend routes."

    message: "Completed comprehensive end-to-end testing of the DRIBBLE e-commerce system. The frontend UI components are working correctly with proper DRIBBLE branding, navigation, and product display. The size chart and inventory management features are functioning as expected, with proper display of stock quantities and sold-out indicators ('X' symbols). The checkout, payment success, and payment cancel pages are accessible and display correctly. The admin panel is also accessible at /admin-ui/dashboard. However, all backend API calls are consistently failing with 502 errors, which prevents any server-side functionality from working properly. This includes product data fetching, cart operations, user authentication, and checkout process. The console logs show numerous API errors with 502 Bad Gateway responses. The root cause appears to be the previously identified issue with the backend server failing to start properly due to import errors."

    message: "FINAL COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TEST RESULTS: Conducted a thorough test of the DRIBBLE e-commerce system as requested. The frontend UI is well-implemented with proper DRIBBLE branding and responsive design. The product category navigation works correctly, allowing users to switch between different product categories (Bio Kneck, Sublimation, Polo Shirts, etc.). The size chart displays correctly with proper inventory management - showing stock quantities for each size/color combination and 'X' symbols for out-of-stock items. The inventory system correctly enforces stock limits, preventing users from adding more items than available (verified with error message: 'Only 50 pieces available for Black S'). The pricing calculation works correctly in the UI, showing regular pricing (319₹) for orders less than 15 pieces. The checkout page, payment success page, payment cancel page, and admin panel are all accessible and display correctly. However, all backend API calls are failing with network errors, preventing actual cart operations, user registration, and checkout functionality from working properly. The console logs show numerous failed API requests with 'net::ERR_ABORTED' errors. This means that while the frontend UI is complete and functional, the actual e-commerce functionality cannot be fully tested due to backend API issues."

    message: "BACKEND ISSUE RESOLVED: Fixed the critical backend startup issue by creating missing .env files. The backend server was failing due to missing MONGO_URL and other environment variables. Created both /app/backend/.env and /app/frontend/.env with required configuration. Backend is now starting successfully and API endpoints are responding correctly. Database has been seeded with 19 categories and product data. Ready for comprehensive testing of all functionality."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested all backend functionality after the .env file fixes. Created and executed a comprehensive test suite (backend_test.py) that verified all major backend components. Authentication system is working correctly with user registration, login, and JWT token validation. Admin vs regular user permissions are properly enforced. Product management is functioning with product listing, filtering, and individual product retrieval. Cart operations work for both authenticated and anonymous users. Order processing correctly calculates taxes, shipping, and handles bulk pricing logic. Category management is working with 19 categories successfully retrieved. Database integration is solid with proper data persistence and retrieval. API security correctly prevents unauthorized access to protected endpoints. All tests passed successfully."
